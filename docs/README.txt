Eannounce plugin for Mantis:

INTRODUCTION:
Many times admins/have to send out emails for the users of Mantis about new features,
new resitricions, downtime notifications etc. So far I was not able to locate a feature
in Mantis which is capable to do this.

INSTALLATION:
Copy the Eannounce plugin folder to your <mantis>/plugins folder, log in as a user who
can manage the plugins and click install next to the Eannounce plugin name. The plugin
is installed now.

CONFIGURATION:
Click to the plugin name in the plugin management page, it will redirects you to the 
config page. There is only one parameter can be configured: the minimum user level to
send out emails to the users.

HOW TO USE:
After you have install the Eannounce plugin it will add a new menu item under the MANAGE
menu called "Send email messages". Authorised users (see CONFIGURATION) are able to open
this page and they can send messages to user groups in Mantis. More than one user group 
can be selected at the same time. All the users in the given user group(s) will recieve 
the mail.

CAUTION:
Be careful to not flood the users with messages, use this feature when its really neccessary
